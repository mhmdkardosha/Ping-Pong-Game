<ul>
  <li> It was a project my professor tasked me to do it.</li>
  <li>It's a ping pong game consisting of 7 classes which were made by OOP concepts.</li>
  <li>It provides two players to play, the first one with "W" and "S", and the second player with arrow keys.</li>
  <li>To make the game more challenging I added a feature that the velocity of the ball increases every time it hits the paddles.</li>
</ul>
